## Hello! I'm Anirudh

A computer science student and tech enthusiast. Welcome to my home on the internet!

### About Me

I'm a sophomore at PES University, Bangalore.
I love exploring and building projects.

I have previously interned as a Systems Engineer at [Bytebeam](https://www.bytebeam.io), where I worked on the next-generation of [rumqttc](https://github.com/bytebeamio/rumqtt), a Rust-based MQTT client.

Some of my interests include systems programming, distributed systems and databases and back-end development. [POW](/pow.html) hosts my proof of work.
