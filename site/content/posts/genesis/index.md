Hello!

This is the first post that I'm writing for this site. It's a proud moment to see my very own home on the internet.

While I began writing this post today, the site in itself has been a long time coming.

### Background

I already had a website running before, written in markdown and rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). While this worked well, it never felt like the final answer. I wanted to power my website with something I'd built myself.
As part of [AIEP](https://acmpesuecc.github.io/aiep), our team, consisting of Adhesh, Aditya, Nathan and me, began working on a custom [static site generator](https://github.com/anna-ssg/anna) in Go.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I've got my site up and running. Staying up late had been worth it.

> Hopefully, this is start of something amazing!
