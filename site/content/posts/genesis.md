Hello!

This is the first post that I'm writing for this site. Indeed, it's a proud moment to see my very own home on the internet.

While I began writing this post today, the site in itself has been a long time coming.

### Background

I already had a website running before, written in markdown and rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). While this worked well, it never felt like the final answer. I wanted to power my website with something I'd built myself.
As part of [AIEP](https://acmpesuecc.github.io/aiep), our team, consisting of Adhesh, Aditya, Nathan and me, began working on a custom [static site generator](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/anna) in Go.

> Fast forward a few weeks, and I've got my site up and running. Staying up late has been worth it.

### Why I made a personal site

I needed a space to share my thoughts with others. A place to showcase who I was as a person, as well as my goals and achievements.
A personal site seemed like a good fit.
Having your own website, available for anyone in the world to access, is a unique feeling.

I also wanted to write often. It could be anything, ranging from a technical article, to some thoughts that I wanted to share.
I believe writing helps me communicate my ideas better. It forces one to do their research, teaching something new in the process. It also reduces mental clutter.

> Hopefully, this is start of something amazing.
