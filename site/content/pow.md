## 2024

#### September

- Conducted a workshop on eBPF(extended Berkeley Packet Filter) at university with my friend Navneet Nayak
  - Link to the [workshop blog](/posts/ebpf-workshop)

#### July

- Worked on a project, HyperDistillation, at the [PES Innovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationlab.in)

  - HyperDistillation utilises eBPF-based gadgets to trace network traffic between containers and hosts, outside of a Kubernetes cluster. It generates a dependency graph that can be filtered and used for various purposes, primarily with DistilledChaos, another project to smartly chaos-test microservices

- Gave a talk on [Anna](https://github.com/anna-ssg/anna), a static site generator written in Go, at the 76th Go Bangalore Meetup, along with my teammates Adhesh Athrey, Aditya Hegde and Nathan Paul

  - Link to the [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/golang-bangalore/) and [slides](https://github.com/anna-ssg/talks), presented using `go tool present`
  - Link to the [project blog](/posts/building-anna)

#### March

- Contributed to Argo CD, a continuous-delivery tool for Kubernetes and a CNCF-graduated project

  - Link to the [issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/17447) and [PR](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17459)

## 2023

#### November

- Gave a talk on [Qapture](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir/Qapture), a command-line tool to recover deleted JPEGs from a forensic RAW image, at the Mentor Expo conducted by HSP, the developer community at our college

  - [Link to the blog](/posts/qapture)
