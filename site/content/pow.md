## 2025

#### February - April

- Interned as a Systems Engineer at [Bytebeam](https://www.bytebeam.io), where I worked on the next-generation of [rumqttc](https://github.com/bytebeamio/rumqtt), a Rust-based MQTT client.
- Redesigned the architecture for the transport layer of rumqttc and implemented it with tests, for optimised memory usage and a simpler interface.

## 2024

#### October

- Presented [Hobbes](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir/hobbes/), a Bitcask-like log structured key value store at the [October 2024 Rust Bangalore Meetup](https://hasgeek.com/rustbangalore/october-2024-rustacean-meetup/sub/building-a-bitcask-like-store-in-rust-5UxqxmzHGEhhdfNmjRfzTm) at Couchbase.

#### September

- Conducted a workshop on eBPF(extended Berkeley Packet Filter) at university with my friend Navneet Nayak
  - Link to the [workshop blog](/posts/ebpf-workshop)

#### July

- Worked on a project, HyperDistillation, at the [PES Innovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationlab.in)

  - HyperDistillation utilises eBPF-based gadgets to trace network traffic between containers and hosts, outside of a Kubernetes cluster. It generates a dependency graph that can be filtered and used for various purposes, primarily with DistilledChaos, another project to smartly chaos-test microservices

- Gave a talk on [Anna](https://github.com/anna-ssg/anna), a static site generator written in Go, at the [76th Go Bangalore Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/golang-bangalore/), along with my teammates Adhesh Athrey, Aditya Hegde and Nathan Paul
